# 2.5.4 Data Flow Management

### Overview

The Data Flow Management feature is a crucial component of the Node-RED platform, providing a centralized interface for managing data flows. Users can view, enable, disable, and delete data flows, as well as bind virtual gateways and view operation records through this page. Additionally, the feature supports filtering and toggling display modes for data flows, facilitating efficient management.

### Key Features

#### **Data Flow List**

* Displays information including Flow ID, Flow Name, Status, and Operations.
* Supports enabling/disabling data flows; flows must be disabled before deletion.
* Supports binding, replacing, and unbinding virtual gateways.
* Allows filtering data flows by Flow ID, Flow Name, and Status.
* Supports list and card display modes.

#### **Operation Records**

* Displays operation records for data flows, including Flow ID, Flow Name, Operation Log, and Operation Time.
* Supports filtering by Flow ID, Flow Name, and Operation Time.

#### **Task Logs**

* Displays log records for data flows at WARN and ERROR levels.
* Display fields include Flow ID, Alert Level, and Operation Time.
* Supports filtering by Flow ID, Alert Level, and Operation Time.

#### **Operational Recommendations**

* When managing data flows, it is advisable to first check the flow status and operation records to ensure accurate operations.
* When binding a virtual gateway, note that a single data flow can only be bound to one virtual gateway to ensure correct configuration.
* Utilize the filtering function to quickly locate the data flow that needs management, enhancing management efficiency.

Through this feature, users can efficiently manage and monitor data flows in Node-RED, ensuring stable operation and efficient processing of data flows.
