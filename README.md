# 1. Overview

### Product Introduction

A rule engine is a software system designed to define, manage, and execute business rules. These rules are typically abstract representations of business logic that dictate how the system should respond under specific conditions. By providing a framework to separate business logic from application code, rule engines enhance the flexibility and maintainability of the system. Our rule engine product aims to help businesses adapt quickly to market changes, simplify the decision-making process, and ensure the consistency and accuracy of business rules.
