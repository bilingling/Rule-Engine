# 2.1.1 Alarm Management

### Overview

The alarm management display page is designed to provide users with an intuitive and efficient interface for managing and responding to system-triggered alarm messages. Through this page, users can quickly grasp the current alarm situation and perform corresponding handling operations to ensure that critical issues are addressed promptly.

### Monitoring Center

* **Monitoring Management**: Offers a list view displaying all added monitoring items, supporting operations such as adding, modifying, deleting, and canceling monitoring.
* **Batch Management**: Allows users to perform batch operations on multiple monitoring items, such as batch enabling/disabling monitoring, batch modifying configurations, etc., to improve management efficiency.
* **Import/Export**: Supports the import and export of monitoring configurations, facilitating the migration of monitoring settings between different environments or systems.
* **Tag Grouping**: Users can tag and group monitoring items based on business needs or system characteristics, making them easier to manage and query.
* **Query Filtering**: Provides powerful query and filtering capabilities, allowing users to quickly locate specific monitoring items based on conditions such as monitoring type, status, tags, etc.
* **Monitoring Details**: Offers an entry to view monitoring details, enabling users to delve into the specific status and historical data of each monitoring item for problem diagnosis and analysis.

### Alarm Center

* **Alarm Management Page**: Provides an interface displaying all triggered alarm messages, including key information such as alarm type, level, timestamp, etc., helping users quickly identify the severity and urgency of issues.
* **Alarm Handling Operations**: Supports users in handling alarm messages, marking them as unresolved, deleting, or clearing in bulk, enhancing the efficiency of alarm response.
* **Alarm Convergence**: When an alarm is triggered, the alarm convergence feature will deduplicate repetitive alarm messages within a specific time frame based on set rules, preventing a large number of repetitive alarms from numbing the recipient. Alarm convergence rules support repetitive alarm effective time periods, tag matching, and alarm level matching filters.
* **Alarm Silence**: The alarm silence feature allows users to block alarm messages during specific one-time or periodic time periods according to rules, ensuring that no alarm messages are sent during system maintenance, non-working hours, or other scenarios where alarms are not needed. Alarm silence rules support one-time or periodic time periods, as well as tag matching and alarm level matching.

Through the rule engine alarm center, enterprises can achieve efficient management of alarm messages, optimize the transmission of alarm information, reduce unnecessary interference, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of alarm response, and ensuring that critical issues are addressed promptly.
